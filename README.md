# Machine Learning for Credit-Default-Prediction
- Final Project DS Bootcamp
- Overview : 
This project focuses on predicting credit default using supervised machine learning models. The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle and consists of 252,000 samples and 12 columns. Each sample contains various features related to credit profiles and historical data of borrowers. The objective is to build a classification model that can accurately predict whether a borrower is likely to default on their credit.

- Results :
After evaluating various machine learning models, the Random Forest model demonstrated the best performance in predicting credit default. The model achieved an accuracy of 88.69%, indicating its ability to make accurate predictions on the test data.
